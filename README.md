# HttpStatusCodePowerToys

A PowerToys Run plugin for searching HTTP status codes. The plugin displays the codes along with their reason-phrase (e.g. "Not Found") and a short sentence describing the function of this code.

Hitting return opens a browser window with the proper RFC for that status code.
