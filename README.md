A [PowerToys Run](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/powertoys/run) plugin for searching HTTP status codes. This plugin displays the codes along with their reason-phrase (e.g. "Not Found") and a short sentence describing the function of this code.

Hitting return opens a browser window with the proper RFC for that status code.
